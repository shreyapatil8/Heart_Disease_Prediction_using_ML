# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as a part of the **“Machine Learning Using Python”** certification course conducted by **Annasaheb Dange College of Engineering and Technology, Ashta**  
(Department of Computer Science and Engineering – IoT & CSBT).

## 📌 Objective  
To build a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease in a patient based on clinical features such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, blood pressure, and ECG results.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used  
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection & correlation heatmap  
- Model building using:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Classification Report  
  - ROC AUC Score  

## 📊 Summary of Results  
- 📌 **Best Performing Model**: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- 🎯 **Accuracy Achieved**: **87.5%**  
- 🔍 The SVM model showed the best balance in classifying both positive and negative heart disease cases.
